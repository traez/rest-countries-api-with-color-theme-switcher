- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project sadly dragged partly because of Childcare and Property Management responsibilities. But in all the learnings were massive, and include:

- Practical project use of Context API.
- Well-written code should be self-explanatory, and comments should be used to provide additional context or clarification on why certain decisions were made in the code (explain the "Why" and not the "What"). Context API adoption made code modular, easier to build, and comments easier to fill in.
- By setting outline: none; you're instructing the browser not to display an outline when the "input" tag element is focused.
- The importance of flexible height (eg: grid-template: 1fr 2fr minmax(545px, auto) / auto;) so page doesn't collapse and distort when there's no content.
- Change color of the input tag placeholder text .mhd-inp::placeholder {color: var(--white); }

### Continued development

- Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Open Source and Technical Writing.
